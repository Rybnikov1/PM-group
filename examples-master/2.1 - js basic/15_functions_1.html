		//Simple named function: 

		function fooName (arg1, arg2 /*, other args, and more*/) {
			//this is a function body - a block of instructions? that will 
			//be executed on function call
			var x, y, z;
			x = parseInt(arg1);
			y = parseInt(arg2);
			//variables declared inside a function a visible only inside that function and (other functions, defined inside it);
			if (!isNaN(x) && !isNaN(y)) {
				return sum(x, y);
				//any instruction after return statement will not be executed
			}

			//a function inside a function - visible like variables, inside the function it was defined instanceof
			function sum (a, b) {
				return a + b;
			}
		}

		//calling a function means specifying it's name with a list of arguments in braces
		//this will execute all instructions in the function with the argument values specified in braces
		temp = fooName(10, 20);
		console.log(temp);

		//you can call a function as many times as you want
		temp = fooName(temp, 30);
		console.log(temp);

		//you cannot call a funtion, that is defined inside another function 
		//from the point in code, that is not inside that function
		if (sum) {
			console.log(sum(10, 20));
